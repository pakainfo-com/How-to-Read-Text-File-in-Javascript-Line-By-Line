In Computer Science, a file is a resource used to record data discretely in a computer's storage device. Node.js doesn't override this in any way and works with anything that is considered a file in your filesystem.

## Reading files and resources have many usages:

Statistics, Analytics, and Reports
Machine Learning
Dealing with large text files or logs
Sometimes, these files can be absurdly large, with gigabytes or terabytes being stored, and reading through them in entirety is inefficient.

Being able to read a file line by line gives us the ability to seek only the relevant information and stop the search once we have found what we're looking for. It also allows us to break up the data into logical pieces, like if the file was CSV-formatted.
